# QR-Code Challenge

I did this project as a challenger from the Frontend Mentor website. I took this opportunity to practice SCSS applying the BEM standard and following the suggetions of the book: CSS in Depth by Keith J. Grant.

It's required to watch the SASS files in order to visualize the file properly, therefore, it's recommended to add an extension.
